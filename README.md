### Basic Usage

1. Open the GitHub Copilot Chat panel (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Shift+I)
2. Start a conversation with QuLeLa by typing:
   ```
   @qulela How do recursion and dynamic programming relate?
   ```
3. Continue the conversation naturally with follow-up questions

### Practice Mode

Generate practice exercises to reinforce learning:

```
/exercise implement a binary search tree in JavaScript
```

The tutor will create increasingly challenging exercises to help you master the concept.

## üìã Example Use Cases

### Learning New Concepts
```
@qulela Explain closures in JavaScript
```

### Understanding Algorithms
```
@qulela How does quicksort work?
```

### Practicing Implementation
